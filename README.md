- Are sales and profit trending up or down over time?  
- Which product categories generate the highest profit?  
- Which retailers contribute most to revenue and margin?  
- How do sales methods (in‑store, online, outlet) perform relative to each other?  
- Which regions and states are driving overall performance?
